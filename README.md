Development is not a long quiet river, but it can be really fun!

Starting today, you are building YOUR project - be proud of it!

Evaluation - Show off!
After the pitch, now you will code - nice right? However don’t forget that you will have to prepare your presentation and share it to your technical mentors.

1. Video Demo of your project
mandatory
Alongside your project presentation, we require a short video demo, no longer than 8 minutes, that showcases the essential features of your project, illustrating how they all work together. This video should include a walkthrough of the slides you prepared in the previous task.

We’ve created a tutorial video to inspire you with our expectations. Think of it as an inspirational tool, not a strict template, designed to help you effectively showcase your brilliant work. Your creativity and individual touch will make your demo even more engaging.








A few points to consider while preparing your video:

Maximum Video Duration: The video should not exceed 8 minutes, ensuring it is concise and engaging.

Background Music: If you include background music, ensure it’s copyright-free to avoid potential legal issues.

Voice-Overs: Your voice-over is mandatory. Ensure your voice is clear, audible, and not overshadowed by the background music.

Recommended Tools: We suggest using

Recording: Zoom(record + screenshare), Loom, Camtasia, etc
Editing tools such as: Filmora Wondershare, Camtasia for your video creation.
How to share: YouTube (or, if blocked in your country, use a similar site), or a cloud storage service (G-drive, One-drive, etc). Submit the URL of your video. Make sure your video is accessible to the public - On YouTube, it’s fine to flag it as “unlisted,” but don’t flag it as “private”
Please note that your project will not be considered complete without this video submission. It forms an integral part of your final project assessment.

So, let’s see your creativity in action.

We are eagerly awaiting your presentations and demo videos.

Happy building,
